Hello and welcome to my first GitHub repository!

The purpose of this repository is twofold.

First, it constitutes a working eclipse java project setup to work with 
processing and the toxiclib physics/math library to display the force-directed graph
sample as presented by the veritable Mr. Daniel Shiffman of great Processing fame.
Original homepage for the sample:
http://www.shiffman.net/itp/classes/nature/toxiclibs_2010/forcedirectedgraph/

Second, I am trying to create a prototype for a graph-based data visualization technique 
involving gesture control via Kinect for Windows(R) for my Master's thesis.
